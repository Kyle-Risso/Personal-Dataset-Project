Hello, this README.md* file explains the process of data analysis for chickens raising and eating. 

The Question that I will attempt to answer in this analysis, is "How good of a business is large scale chicken production?"

Through the research that I have done, I have concluded that large scale chicken production is a massively good industry. Some sources that I've taken from the National Chicken Foundation have pelnty of infomration on why broiler chickens are sold in the market everyday and how they became such good sellers. 

First, by going into the repository and looking at ChickenStats1, you'll see just how much broiler chickens are sold for in terms of retail and wholesale. you can recreate the scatter plot by generating a code that measures Wholesale chickens against the year. You can see that chicken prices increased over the years since 1960. They did go down in an anomaly somewhere around 2015. This can most likely be explained by the epidemic of bird flu that was going around at the time that killed many chickens. 

taking a look at the second Chicken Stats csv. It can be seen that chicken often matches up quite well with the other meats on the market. However, chicken seems to have beaten all of the other types of meat individually with the second runner up being beef.

The graph for this data can be represented by a bart chart of each of the different meats that were sold in mass produce in 2021. You'll see that chicken is the highest by a long shot with beef and then pork and then turkey coming subsequently.

This graph can be reproduced by measuring a barplot command with chicken, beef, pork, and turkey as the other contenders.

The last chart comes from Chicken Stats3 csv which explains the live weight and number of chickens per state. It doesn't show all the states but it shows the biggest ones in terms of chicken production. There is a square for other states as well for comparison. This graph shows that chickens are produced on a gigantic scale in southern states. This can probably be explained because southern states take in a lot of chicken, many southern diets have lots of chicken in them, as well as restaurants get lots of chicken from southern states because they are southern based and southern themed, an example of this would be Popeye's (Louisiana) and KFC (Kentucky). 

This pie chart can be reproduced using the pie function and matching up the number of chickens per state as the basis for the pie chart. The legend is constructed from the line of states.

While the rest of the Chicken Stats csvs dont have corresponding graphs and charts. I will share my findings with you. 

Chicken Stats 4 is all about exports of chickens. It is shown that chicken exports have grown exponenetailly over the past 60 years. it also shows that more money is being made per chicken in the exports because the return percentage has grown quite a lot as well. It really took off in the 90s when it started getting into double digits. 

Chicken Stats 6 is all about the cost of feeding the animal. This way is the best way of determine whether or not it is a burden to take care of and raise the chickens for food production. The graph is relatively short and starts out on 1925 and has incremental data here and there up until 2005 and then which the data is annually based. It shows over the years that farmers have cut cost on chicken production by making them heavier and selling them sooner rather than later. This would increase a cost in food but getting the chickens out sooner allows for a more efficient business and may in fact be more profitable.

This concluded my research on how effective it is to farm chickens for a living. Hope you enjoyed!
